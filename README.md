Eco-Dynamo -The resourceful approach

The conversion of heat to electricity is a fundamental aspect of thermoelectricity. Thermoelectricity is the direct conversion of heat into electricity using a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect. This effect occurs when a temperature difference is applied across a thermoelectric material, resulting in the generation of an electric voltage. This voltage can then be used to power electronic devices or stored in batteries.

Thermoelectric materials are used in various applications, including power generation in spacecraft, waste heat recovery in industrial processes, and portable refrigeration devices. Research in thermoelectric materials focuses on improving their efficiency and reliability to make them more practical for widespread use in energy harvesting and conversion applications.

In a hybrid car, both internal combustion engines (ICE) and electric motors are used for propulsion. A significant amount of heat is generated during the operation of the ICE, which is often wasted. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) is employed to capture some of this waste heat and convert it into electricity. This electricity could then be used to charge the car's battery or power auxiliary systems, reducing the overall fuel consumption of the vehicle.One of the biggest examples of  this is the Honda Civic Car

In our project, we harness the Peltier effect to power spacecraft through radioisotope thermoelectric generators, demonstrating the versatility of thermoelectric technology beyond solar energy applications. Moreover, we showcase the potential of piezoelectric energy harvesting as an alternative to fossil fuels, underscoring our commitment to sustainable energy practices. Our project serves as a small-scale replication of a larger concept, embodying a group of interconnected ideas aimed at promoting environmentally friendly energy solutions

Components:-
◦	Arduino Nano 
	◦	 Peltier Module
	◦	Display
	◦	Zero PCB 
	◦	Temperature sensor ds18b20
	◦	Heat sink and  Fan
	◦	USB type A socket
	◦	Buck convertor 

How it works?
I.In the Peltier effect, when an electric current passes through a Peltier module, one side of the module absorbs heat (becomes cold) while the other side releases heat (becomes hot). This temperature difference is what creates the potential for generating electricity.
II.Incorporation of a heat sink and fan to maintain temperature differentials for efficient thermoelectric conversion.
III.Utilization of a display, controlled by Arduino Nano, to provide real-time feedback on energy generation and usage.
IV.Storage of generated electricity in a battery for later use can charge a mobile phone as well

Conclusion:-
Through the utilization of innovative energy harvesting technologies such as thermoelectric and piezoelectric conversion, our project aims to enhance overall energy efficiency. By capturing and utilizing previously wasted energy, we have the potential to significantly increase the efficiency curve from its conventional 30% to an impressive 60%. This paradigm shift towards sustainable energy practices underscores the importance of exploring alternative energy sources and highlights the transformative impact they can have on our energy landscape.
